{"title": "Apartment to share in Paris' Promised Land", "price": "\u20ac900", "body": "\n\nQR Code Link to This Post\n\n\nA fantastic, 55 square meter apartment with a big kitchen, a big living room and a little balcony. Aside from his or her room \u2013 which is entierely furnished \u2013 my roommate will dispose of storage shelves in the bathroom, cupboards in the kitchen, as well as his or her own fridge. There\u2019s a washer-dryer in the apartment. It\u2019s situated on a pedestrian walkway, so there\u2019s no traffic noise. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s facing north. In other words it\u2019s cool in the summer (it doesn\u2019t become a steambath) and warm in the winter (individual heating with natural gas). There\u2019s a caretaker in the building.\n\nWe\u2019re in a neighbourhood which is quiet, yet accessible to all budgets. The building is located next to an Autolib' station, a V\u00e9lib' station, a bus stop, a metro station and the tramway. It\u2019s near the Parc de la Villette in the 19th District. \nIn the apartment there will be you, me and my cat. I\u2019m looking for a roommate ready to do his or her share of the housework in the common parts of the apartment and to share the rent, for an equitable and convivial cohabitation.\n", "post_id": "7386790000", "created_time": "2021-09-28T20:41:53+0200"}
